  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Adolescent mental health in the United States is in crisis. Large national surveys show that
    a growing share of high school students report feeling persistently sad or hopeless, struggling
    with anxiety, and having thoughts of suicide. These trends did not begin with the COVID-19
    pandemic, but the pandemic magnified isolation, academic pressure, and uncertainty.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, young people’s social lives, identities, and coping strategies are increasingly
    shaped by AI-driven digital platforms. Social media feeds, recommendation algorithms, targeted
    ads, and push notifications determine what youth see, how they compare themselves to others,
    and how easy it is to disengage from harmful content. Yet the data that could help us understand
    these systems – and regulate them – largely live inside private companies.
  </p>

  <h2>How AI and Social Media Intensify Risk</h2>
  <p>
    Modern platforms rely on machine learning systems that constantly experiment on users to maximize
    engagement. These algorithms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prioritize content that triggers strong emotional reactions, even when that content feeds anxiety, anger, or shame.</li>
    <li>Reinforce comparison culture by filling feeds with idealized bodies, lifestyles, and achievement narratives.</li>
    <li>Make it easy to “fall into” spirals of content around self-harm, disordered eating, or hopelessness.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For many young people, especially girls, LGBTQ+ youth, and students of color, online environments
    can amplify offline discrimination and stress. Harassment, racist or sexist content, and algorithmic
    bias add extra burdens on top of existing structural inequalities in education, health care, and
    housing.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Gaps and Policy Blind Spots</h2>
  <p>
    Despite mounting concern from parents, educators, and clinicians, U.S. policymakers still operate
    with fragmented and delayed information about how digital environments affect youth. Existing public
    health surveys track mental health outcomes, but they rarely include detailed measures of digital
    behavior or platform-specific risks. Meanwhile, platforms possess granular data on what youth see,
    click, and report – but share almost none of it in usable, standardized ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    This misalignment produces a dangerous paradox: the institutions responsible for protecting youth
    mental health are flying blind, while the companies shaping youth experiences have the richest
    behavioral datasets in history. Without better data, regulation is reactive, slow, and vulnerable
    to industry lobbying and anecdotal panics.
  </p>

  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>
    The stakes of this problem are shared across multiple groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adolescents</strong> who live the consequences of digital design choices and policy delays.</li>
    <li><strong>Parents and caregivers</strong> who are told to “monitor their kids’ screens” but lack structural support.</li>
    <li><strong>Educators and schools</strong> who see mental health struggles in classrooms and counseling centers.</li>
    <li><strong>Mental health professionals</strong> trying to respond to algorithmically amplified crises with limited resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology companies</strong> whose profit models are built on attention but who face growing public scrutiny.</li>
    <li><strong>Policymakers</strong> who must balance innovation, free expression, and youth protection without solid evidence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A core argument of this project is that closing the data gap is a prerequisite for any serious
    youth digital well-being agenda. The following pages outline what we know from existing surveys,
    explore policy options, and propose a federal initiative to generate the data we actually need.
