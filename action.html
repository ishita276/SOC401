  <h2>A Student Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    When I moved thousands of miles to attend college, everyone told me Seattle would be a place
    full of opportunity: cutting-edge tech, beautiful nature, progressive politics. What I did not
    expect was how lonely and overwhelmed I would feel trying to navigate a new culture, a new
    education system, and a campus social life that seemed to live entirely online.
  </p>
  <p>
    On paper, my university has a mental health system: counseling services, crisis lines,
    wellness workshops. In practice, the wait for an intake appointment can stretch for weeks, and
    international students often face extra barriers—insurance confusion, visa anxiety, stigma, and
    the constant pressure not to “waste” the chance their families sacrificed so much to give them.
  </p>
  <p>
    During those weeks, my main support system was my phone. My days were split between lectures,
    problem sets, and endless scrolling. Social media made it look like everyone else had already
    found their friend group, their calling, and their perfect Pacific Northwest hiking spot. My own
    feed was a carefully curated highlight reel that hid the panic attacks between classes and the
    nights I couldn’t sleep.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Data and Stories Both Matter</h2>
  <p>
    My experience is not unique. Students bring their own histories of depression, family stress,
    and trauma with them to college. When you layer on academic pressure and AI-driven platforms
    that profit from keeping us constantly online, it becomes clear that this is not just an
    individual resilience issue—it is a systems issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The numbers on the <a href="data.html">Evidence &amp; Data</a> page show how common sadness and
    hopelessness have become. But behind each percentage point is a student waiting for a therapy
    appointment, a teenager doomscrolling through the night, or a young person trying to decide
    whether it feels safe to ask for help. Policy needs both quantitative data and lived experience.
  </p>

  <h2>What Different Actors Can Do</h2>

  <h3>Federal Policymakers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support legislation that creates a Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative with strong privacy protections.</li>
    <li>Fund research and public dashboards that make youth mental health and digital behavior trends visible.</li>
    <li>Pair data efforts with enforceable rules on youth safety, privacy, and algorithmic accountability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Universities and Schools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Track and publish basic metrics like counseling wait times, caseloads, and utilization by student group.</li>
    <li>Invest in culturally competent, multilingual mental health support, including for international students.</li>
    <li>Teach digital well-being and media literacy as core skills, not optional extras.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Parents, Caregivers, and Community Members</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Have ongoing, nonjudgmental conversations with young people about their online lives.</li>
    <li>Advocate for policies that prioritize youth mental health over platform profits.</li>
    <li>Support community programs that provide offline spaces for connection and rest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Young People</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Share your stories—in student government, community meetings, and online campaigns—about how digital environments affect you.</li>
    <li>Experiment with small changes: device-free zones, sleep-friendly routines, and peer support networks.</li>
    <li>Demand a seat at the table when adults make decisions about technology and education “for your own good.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We cannot scroll our way out of this crisis, and we cannot fix it one campus at a time. But we
    also do not have to choose between innovation and mental health. With better data, stronger
    protections, and youth leadership, we can design digital spaces—and policies—that help young
    people feel more connected, not more alone.
