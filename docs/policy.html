  <h2>Policy options</h2>

  <p>
    Addressing youth mental health risks linked to AI-driven digital platforms
    requires policy responses that go beyond individual behavior change.
    Policymakers face several potential approaches, each with distinct
    strengths and limitations.
  </p>

  <h3>Option 1: Platform risk assessments</h3>

  <p>
    Platform risk assessment requirements would mandate that technology
    companies regularly evaluate and disclose how their products may affect
    youth mental health. These assessments are intended to increase
    transparency and encourage companies to identify harmful design features.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Can expose internal knowledge about how algorithms amplify harmful
      content or encourage excessive engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Creates a formal record that regulators and researchers can review.
    </li>
    <li>
      Signals that youth mental health is a public responsibility, not just
      a private concern.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    However, this approach relies heavily on self-reporting and enforcement.
    Without independent data or standardized metrics, risk assessments may
    vary widely in quality and offer limited insight into real-world impact.
    On their own, they provide information but not necessarily timely action.
  </p>

  <h3>Option 2: Youth-centered design requirements</h3>

  <p>
    Youth-centered design regulations focus on modifying platform features
    to reduce harm. This can include high-privacy defaults for minors,
    restrictions on addictive design elements, and limits on targeted
    recommendations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Directly addresses features known to increase excessive use and
      emotional stress.
    </li>
    <li>
      Shifts responsibility away from individual self-control and toward
      platform design.
    </li>
    <li>
      Offers clear, enforceable rules that can reduce some forms of harm.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While important, design requirements face practical limits. Platforms
    evolve quickly, and static rules may struggle to keep pace with new
    features or emerging risks. Without ongoing data, it is difficult to
    know which design changes are most effective or whether unintended
    consequences arise.
  </p>

  <h3>Option 3: Federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative (recommended)</h3>

  <p>
    The Federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative addresses a core
    weakness shared by other approaches: the lack of timely, standardized
    information about how digital environments affect young people.
  </p>

  <p>
    This initiative would establish a federally coordinated framework for
    collecting, analyzing, and sharing data on youth screen use, mental
    well-being, and access to school-based supports - while protecting privacy
    and student autonomy.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Creates consistent indicators that allow comparison across time,
      platforms, and populations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enables early identification of emerging risks rather than reacting
      only after harm becomes widespread.
    </li>
    <li>
      Supports schools and public agencies with evidence to target resources
      where they are most needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improves transparency without requiring disclosure of individual-level
      data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Importantly, this approach does not replace regulation or design
    requirements. Instead, it strengthens them by providing the evidence
    base needed to evaluate effectiveness, refine policy, and hold systems
    accountable over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Why the data initiative is the strongest foundation</h2>

  <p>
    The evidence presented in the <a href="data.html">Evidence & Data</a> section
    shows that youth digital risk is widespread but unevenly distributed.
    Students who report the greatest distress are often the least likely
    to feel supported by existing systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without better data, policymakers are left responding to headlines rather
    than trends. A federal data initiative shifts the response from reactive
    to preventative by making youth digital well-being visible and measurable.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      It complements platform oversight rather than duplicating it.
    </li>
    <li>
      It supports school-based mental health systems with actionable insight.
    </li>
    <li>
      It allows future regulation to be targeted, proportional, and evidence-driven.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short, effective youth digital policy requires more than rules alone.
    It requires a shared understanding of risk, grounded in data that serves
    the public interest.
