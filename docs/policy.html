  <h2>Policy Options</h2>

  <p>
    Policymakers have several possible approaches for addressing the growing
    impact of AI-driven digital platforms on youth mental health. Each option
    offers potential benefits, but they differ in scope, feasibility, and
    effectiveness.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Platform Risk Assessments</h3>
  <p>
    This approach would require technology companies to evaluate and disclose
    the potential mental health risks associated with their products and
    algorithms.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encourages platforms to identify and acknowledge potential harms.</li>
    <li>Improves transparency around design choices and content amplification.</li>
    <li>Relies heavily on self-reporting and enforcement capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Youth-Centered Design Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    Youth-centered design rules would mandate safer default settings and
    restrict features known to increase excessive engagement among adolescents.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stronger privacy defaults for minors.</li>
    <li>Limits on features that promote compulsive use.</li>
    <li>Can reduce harm, but may struggle to adapt to rapidly changing platforms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative <em>(Recommended)</em></h3>
  <p>
    The recommended approach focuses on building a stronger public data
    infrastructure to monitor youth digital well-being and guide evidence-based
    policy responses.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Establishes standardized indicators for youth screen use, mental health,
      and access to school-based supports.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enables privacy-protective, aggregated data sharing between platforms,
      researchers, and public agencies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Supports real-time dashboards and early warning systems to identify
      emerging risks.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this approach is preferred</h2>
  <p>
    As the evidence on the <a href="data.html">Evidence & Data</a> page shows,
    youth mental health risks linked to digital environments are widespread,
    unevenly distributed, and difficult to detect early.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without timely and comparable data, policymakers are forced to respond
    reactively—often after harm has already occurred. A federal data initiative
    addresses this gap directly by making youth digital well-being visible,
    measurable, and actionable.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      It complements platform regulation rather than replacing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      It helps schools anticipate need instead of responding only in crisis.
    </li>
    <li>
      It creates accountability without relying solely on individual behavior
      change.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short, better data is not a substitute for regulation—it is the
    foundation that makes effective, targeted policy possible.
