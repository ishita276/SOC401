  <h2>What’s happening</h2>
  <p>
    Youth mental health has worsened over the last decade. At the same time, teens spend more
    time inside digital environments shaped by AI-driven feeds and recommendations. This project
    focuses on how that combo can increase risk - and why schools and policymakers need better
    information to respond.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Core idea:</strong> When screen time rises and online content gets more “sticky,”
    well-being can drop - and the students who may need support most aren’t always the ones who
    feel connected to trusted help.
  </div>

  <h2>How AI-driven platforms intensify risk</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>1) Engagement beats well-being</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Algorithms prioritize content that keeps people scrolling (not what’s healthiest).</li>
        <li>Negative, emotional, or extreme content can get rewarded with attention.</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems can lead users from “mild” content to more intense material.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>2) Social comparison is built in</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Curated feeds can amplify body-image pressure and “everyone is happier than me” thinking.</li>
        <li>Likes/metrics can turn identity and popularity into a constant scoreboard.</li>
        <li>Sleep loss from late-night use can make stress and mood worse the next day.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Who is most affected</h2>
  <p>
    Digital harms don’t hit everyone evenly. Some groups face extra exposure to harassment,
    discrimination, or targeted content — and may have fewer offline supports available.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Girls</strong> often face stronger appearance pressure and social comparison.</li>
    <li><strong>LGBTQ+ youth</strong> may face higher harassment risk and fewer safe offline spaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Students of color</strong> can experience bias, hate content, and unequal access to support.</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>Why this is a policy problem</h2>

<p>
  Framing youth digital harm as a matter of individual choice misses the larger structural
  reality. Today’s online environments are not neutral spaces. They are designed systems,
  shaped by algorithms that determine what content young people see, how often they see it,
  and how long they remain engaged.
</p>

<p>
  When those systems consistently reward emotional intensity, comparison, and constant
  engagement, they create conditions that can undermine mental well-being—especially for
  adolescents who are still developing emotionally and socially. Expecting young people
  to simply “self-regulate” in these environments places responsibility on individuals
  while ignoring the role of platform design.
</p>

<p>
  This makes youth digital well-being a public concern, not just a private one.
  Schools, families, and health systems are already responding to the consequences of
  digital distress, yet they have little influence over the systems that help produce it.
  Without coordinated policy action, the burden of managing risk falls almost entirely
  on those least equipped to do so.
</p>


 <h2>The biggest obstacle: data gaps</h2>

<p>
  Despite the scale of the problem, public institutions lack the information needed to respond
  effectively. Policymakers and schools rely on periodic surveys and fragmented data that
  capture trends only after harm has already occurred.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, technology platforms collect detailed, real-time information about youth
  engagement and behavior, but this data remains largely inaccessible to researchers,
  educators, and regulators. Without timely, transparent, and standardized data,
  it is difficult to identify emerging risks, evaluate interventions, or hold systems
  accountable.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Public surveys capture trends, but often with limited detail and slow turnaround.</li>
    <li>Platforms have the “real-time” picture, but the public can’t easily audit or compare it.</li>
    <li>Without better data, it’s hard to target resources, measure impact, or build smart regulation.</li>
  </ul>

 

  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adolescents</strong> (health, identity, safety)</li>
    <li><strong>Parents & caregivers</strong> (guidance, monitoring, support)</li>
    <li><strong>Schools</strong> (prevention, counseling capacity, trusted access points)</li>
    <li><strong>Mental health professionals</strong> (care pathways, referral networks)</li>
    <li><strong>Technology companies</strong> (design choices, transparency, accountability)</li>
    <li><strong>Policymakers</strong> (public health response, standards, oversight)</li>
  </ul>
