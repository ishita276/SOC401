  <h2>What’s happening</h2>
  <p>
    Youth mental health has worsened over the last decade. At the same time, teens spend more
    time inside digital environments shaped by AI-driven feeds and recommendations. This project
    focuses on how that combo can increase risk — and why schools and policymakers need better
    information to respond.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Core idea:</strong> When screen time rises and online content gets more “sticky,”
    well-being can drop — and the students who may need support most aren’t always the ones who
    feel connected to trusted help.
  </div>

  <h2>How AI-driven platforms intensify risk</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>1) Engagement beats well-being</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Algorithms prioritize content that keeps people scrolling (not what’s healthiest).</li>
        <li>Negative, emotional, or extreme content can get rewarded with attention.</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems can lead users from “mild” content to more intense material.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>2) Social comparison is built in</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Curated feeds can amplify body-image pressure and “everyone is happier than me” thinking.</li>
        <li>Likes/metrics can turn identity and popularity into a constant scoreboard.</li>
        <li>Sleep loss from late-night use can make stress and mood worse the next day.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Who is most affected</h2>
  <p>
    Digital harms don’t hit everyone evenly. Some groups face extra exposure to harassment,
    discrimination, or targeted content — and may have fewer offline supports available.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Girls</strong> often face stronger appearance pressure and social comparison.</li>
    <li><strong>LGBTQ+ youth</strong> may face higher harassment risk and fewer safe offline spaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Students of color</strong> can experience bias, hate content, and unequal access to support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this is a policy problem (not just “personal choice”)</h2>
  <p>
    This isn’t only about individual self-control. The environment is engineered: AI systems shape
    what youth see, how long they stay, and what content gets repeated. That means the response
    can’t rely on “just log off” — it needs better guardrails and better support systems.
  </p>

  <h2>The biggest obstacle: data gaps</h2>
  <p>
    Schools and public agencies don’t have enough timely, usable information to track digital
    well-being risks or evaluate what actually helps. Platforms hold detailed behavioral data,
    but it’s not shared in consistent, policy-ready ways.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public surveys capture trends, but often with limited detail and slow turnaround.</li>
    <li>Platforms have the “real-time” picture, but the public can’t easily audit or compare it.</li>
    <li>Without better data, it’s hard to target resources, measure impact, or build smart regulation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small">
    This is why the next sections matter: the <a href="data.html">Evidence & Data</a> page shows what
    national survey data can already tell us, and the <a href="policy.html">Policy Solution</a> page
    explains how a stronger data infrastructure can support youth protection and school-based help.
  </p>

  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adolescents</strong> (health, identity, safety)</li>
    <li><strong>Parents & caregivers</strong> (guidance, monitoring, support)</li>
    <li><strong>Schools</strong> (prevention, counseling capacity, trusted access points)</li>
    <li><strong>Mental health professionals</strong> (care pathways, referral networks)</li>
    <li><strong>Technology companies</strong> (design choices, transparency, accountability)</li>
    <li><strong>Policymakers</strong> (public health response, standards, oversight)</li>
  </ul>
