  <h2>Why action matters</h2>
  <p>
    The data and policy analysis presented on this site point to a clear conclusion:
    youth digital harm is not a distant or abstract problem. It is already shaping
    how students feel, learn, and cope. Addressing it requires action at multiple
    levels - by policymakers, institutions, communities, and students themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>A student perspective</h2>
  <p>
    As an international student navigating academic pressure, cultural adjustment,
    and limited access to mental health resources, I have experienced how digital
    platforms can function as both a coping mechanism and a source of distress.
  </p>

  <p>
    When support systems feel distant or difficult to access, online spaces often
    become the default outlet. This makes the design of digital environments - and
    the availability of trusted, offline support - especially consequential for
    students already facing multiple stressors.
  </p>

  <h2>What different actors can do</h2>

  <h3>Federal policymakers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Support the creation of a Federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative
      to improve transparency and early identification of risk.
    </li>
    <li>
      Require youth-focused impact assessments and data reporting from major
      technology platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Invest in school-based mental health infrastructure alongside digital
      oversight efforts.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Schools and universities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Track and publicly report indicators such as counseling wait times,
      utilization, and student satisfaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expand culturally competent and multilingual mental health services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrate digital well-being education into orientation and student support
      programs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Parents and community organizations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create open, non-punitive spaces for conversations about online stress,
      comparison, and digital overload.
    </li>
    <li>
      Advocate for local school and community investment in youth mental health
      resources.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support initiatives that promote balanced digital habits without stigma.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Students</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Share lived experiences to help make digital mental health risks visible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participate in student organizations and advocacy efforts focused on
      mental health and digital well-being.
    </li>
    <li>
      Push institutions to treat mental health support as a core part of student
      success, not an optional service.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Moving forward</h2>
  <p>
    Effective change will not come from a single policy or tool. It requires
    coordinated action that recognizes youth digital well-being as both a
    public health issue and a matter of equity.
  </p>

  <p>
    By combining better data, stronger institutions, and sustained advocacy,
    it is possible to build digital environments - and support systems - that
    prioritize youth well-being over engagement alone.
