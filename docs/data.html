    <h2>Interactive Data Dashboard</h2>

      This page synthesizes national survey data to examine how adolescent screen time, mental well-being, and access to school-based mental health supports intersect. Drawing on the <strong>Monitoring the Future (MTF)</strong> study and the <strong>Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)</strong>, the dashboard visualizations below move beyond correlations to highlight where current school mental health systems succeed, and where they fall short for students most at risk.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Positive Outcomes by Screen Time </h3>
    <p>
  <strong>How to read this chart:</strong> These lines compare the share of students who report
  (1) being very happy, (2) finding school counseling helpful, and (3) finding school mental health
  resources helpful across screen-time groups. Use the legend to toggle outcomes; hover to see exact values.

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">2. Digital Well-Being Profile by Screen Time (Interactive Radar)</h3>
    <p>
  <strong>How to read this chart:</strong> Each shape represents a screen-time group. Points farther from
  the center indicate a higher share of students reporting that outcome. Hover for exact values and use the legend
  to toggle groups.

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">What this dashboard shows</h3>
    <p>
      These charts use MTF survey data on 12th graders. Screen-time is
      grouped into three categories: less than 3 hours, 3–6 hours, and
      7+ hours of video/TV on devices on a typical weekday. The outcomes
      are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Very happy</strong> – students who describe themselves as very happy overall.</li>
      <li><strong>Counseling helpful</strong> – students who say school counseling is quite or extremely helpful.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental health resources helpful</strong> – students who say school mental health resources are quite or extremely helpful.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Looking across the dashboard, students with <strong>lower daily screen
      time</strong> are more likely to report being very happy and to see
      school-based supports as helpful. As screen time rises into the 7+ hour
      range, the share of “very happy” students drops, and fewer students feel
      strongly positive about school counseling and mental health resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together with the YRBS findings (which show how common high screen time
      is among U.S. high school students), this dashboard supports the
      argument in my op-ed and policy brief: schools need to both
      <strong>address heavy digital use</strong> and <strong>strengthen
      visible, trusted mental health supports</strong>, especially for the
      students who are online the most.

      The chart below shows the proportion of U.S. high school students who report
      spending <strong>3+ hours of daily screen time</strong> outside of schoolwork, broken
      down by gender, using nationally representative YRBS 2021 data.
