    <h2>Interactive Data Dashboard</h2>

<p>
  This page brings together national survey data to explore how
  adolescent screen time, mental well-being, and perceptions of
  school-based mental health supports are connected.
  The visualizations below combine findings from the
  <strong>Monitoring the Future (MTF)</strong> study and the
  <strong>Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than focusing on screen time alone, this dashboard highlights
  how digital habits intersect with student happiness and confidence in
  school mental health resources.
</p>
<h3>How to use this dashboard</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Interactive charts allow you to hover over data points to see exact percentages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Legends can be clicked to hide or show specific outcomes.
  </li>

  <li>
    All percentages represent <strong>within-group comparisons</strong>,
    not totals across all students.
  </li>
</ul>


    <h3>Positive Outcomes by Screen Time</h3>

<p>
  This interactive chart shows how three indicators of student well-being
  vary across levels of weekday screen time:
  being very happy, finding school counseling helpful,
  and finding school mental health resources helpful.
</p>

<p>
  Screen time is grouped into three categories:
  less than 3 hours, 3–6 hours, and 7+ hours per weekday.
  Hover over the chart to see exact values and use the legend
  to compare outcomes across groups.
</p>

   <h3>Digital Well-Being Profile by Screen Time</h3>

<p>
  The radar chart summarizes how well-being and support perceptions
  cluster together within each screen-time group.
  Each shape represents a different level of screen use.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Larger shapes indicate higher shares of students reporting positive outcomes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smaller shapes suggest weaker well-being or lower confidence in supports.
  </li>
  <li>
    Differences between groups highlight how screen time may compound
    emotional and institutional support gaps.
  </li>
</ul>

      <h3>What the MTF data shows</h3>

<p>
  Across the MTF visualizations, a consistent pattern emerges.
  Students with <strong>lower daily screen time</strong> are more likely
  to report being very happy and to view school-based mental health supports
  as helpful.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Higher screen use is associated with <strong>lower reported happiness</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students in the 7+ hour group are less likely to see
    counseling and mental health resources as effective.
  </li>
  <li>
    These trends suggest that heavy digital engagement may coincide
    with weaker emotional well-being and lower institutional trust.
  </li>
</ul>

  <section class="card">
   <h2>Screen Time by Gender (YRBS 2021)</h2>

<p>
  While the MTF data shows how outcomes differ by screen time,
  YRBS data highlights how common high screen use is among U.S.
  high school students.
</p>

<p>
  The chart below shows the share of students reporting
  <strong>3 or more hours of daily screen time</strong> outside of schoolwork,
  broken down by gender.
</p>

    <img src="screen_by_gender.png" alt="Screen time by gender (YRBS 2021)">
    <h3>What this dashboard shows</h3>

<p>
  These charts draw on national data from the
  <strong>Monitoring the Future (MTF)</strong> survey of 12th graders.
  Students are grouped by weekday screen time
  (&lt;3 hours, 3–6 hours, and 7+ hours of video or TV use),
  and outcomes focus on well-being and perceptions of
  school-based mental health supports.
</p>

<p>
  The dashboard highlights three key outcomes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Very happy</strong> – students who describe themselves as very happy overall.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Counseling helpful</strong> – students who say school counseling is quite or extremely helpful.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mental health resources helpful</strong> – students who say school mental health resources
    are quite or extremely helpful.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Looking across the visualizations, a consistent pattern emerges.
  Students with <strong>lower daily screen time</strong> are more likely
  to report being very happy and to view school-based supports as helpful.
  As screen time rises into the <strong>7+ hour range</strong>, reported happiness declines,
  and fewer students express strong confidence in counseling and mental health resources.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Lower screen time is associated with <strong>higher emotional well-being</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students with heavier screen use are less likely to see
    <strong>school mental health supports as effective</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    These gaps suggest that students most engaged online may also be
    <strong>least connected to trusted support systems</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When viewed alongside YRBS data—which shows that
  <strong>high screen time is common among U.S. high school students</strong>—
  these findings reinforce the central argument of this project.
  Schools must not only address heavy digital use,
  but also <strong>strengthen visible, accessible, and trusted mental health supports</strong>,
  especially for students who appear most at risk.

<h2>From screen time to support systems</h2>

<p>
  Taken together, the MTF and YRBS findings raise a critical follow-up question:
  <strong>Do school-based mental health supports reach students equitably—and do
  students perceive them as helpful across demographic groups?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The interactive dashboard below explores this question by examining how
  students’ perceptions of counseling, group counseling, and mental health
  curricula vary by <strong>race, gender, self-reported happiness, and future
  outlook</strong>.
</p>

 <h2>Interactive Mental Health Support Dashboard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the dropdown filters to explore differences by race,
    gender, happiness level, and future outlook.
  </li>
  <li>
    Charts update automatically based on your selections.
  </li>
  <li>
    All charts display the distribution of responses within each group.
