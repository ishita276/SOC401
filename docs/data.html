    <h2>Interactive Data Dashboard</h2>

<p>
  This page brings together national survey data to explore how
  adolescent screen time, mental well-being, and perceptions of
  school-based mental health supports are connected.
  The visualizations below combine findings from the
  <strong>Monitoring the Future (MTF)</strong> study and the
  <strong>Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than focusing on screen time alone, this dashboard highlights
  how digital habits intersect with student happiness and confidence in
  school mental health resources.
</p>
<h3>How to use this dashboard</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Interactive charts allow you to hover over data points to see exact percentages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Legends can be clicked to hide or show specific outcomes.
  </li>

  <li>
    All percentages represent <strong>within-group comparisons</strong>,
    not totals across all students.
  </li>
</ul>


    <h3>Positive Outcomes by Screen Time</h3>

<p>
  This interactive chart shows how three indicators of student well-being
  vary across levels of weekday screen time:
  being very happy, finding school counseling helpful,
  and finding school mental health resources helpful.
</p>

<p>
  Screen time is grouped into three categories:
  less than 3 hours, 3–6 hours, and 7+ hours per weekday.
  Hover over the chart to see exact values and use the legend
  to compare outcomes across groups.
</p>

   <h3>Digital Well-Being Profile by Screen Time</h3>

<p>
  The radar chart summarizes how well-being and support perceptions
  cluster together within each screen-time group.
  Each shape represents a different level of screen use.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Larger shapes indicate higher shares of students reporting positive outcomes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smaller shapes suggest weaker well-being or lower confidence in supports.
  </li>
  <li>
    Differences between groups highlight how screen time may compound
    emotional and institutional support gaps.
  </li>
</ul>

      <h3>What the MTF data shows</h3>

<p>
  Across the MTF visualizations, a consistent pattern emerges.
  Students with <strong>lower daily screen time</strong> are more likely
  to report being very happy and to view school-based mental health supports
  as helpful.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Higher screen use is associated with <strong>lower reported happiness</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students in the 7+ hour group are less likely to see
    counseling and mental health resources as effective.
  </li>
  <li>
    These trends suggest that heavy digital engagement may coincide
    with weaker emotional well-being and lower institutional trust.
  </li>
</ul>

  <!-- ====== SECTION 2: YRBS chart image ====== -->
  <section class="card">
   <h2>Screen Time by Gender (YRBS 2021)</h2>

<p>
  While the MTF data shows how outcomes differ by screen time,
  YRBS data highlights how common high screen use is among U.S.
  high school students.
</p>

<p>
  The chart below shows the share of students reporting
  <strong>3 or more hours of daily screen time</strong> outside of schoolwork,
  broken down by gender.
</p>

    <img src="screen_by_gender.png" alt="Screen time by gender (YRBS 2021)">
   <h3>What the YRBS data adds</h3>

<p>
  While the MTF dashboard shows how outcomes differ by screen time,
  the YRBS data highlights how widespread high screen use is among
  U.S. high school students.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A large share of students report spending <strong>3 or more hours per day</strong>
    on screens outside of schoolwork.
  </li>
  <li>
    High screen time is common across genders, not limited to a small subgroup.
  </li>
  <li>
    This means the risks identified in the MTF data affect
    <strong>millions of students nationwide</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Putting the findings together</h3>

<p>
  Viewed together, the MTF and YRBS data tell a consistent story.
  High screen time is not only common among U.S. adolescents,
  but it is also linked to lower emotional well-being and weaker
  connections to school-based mental health supports.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>YRBS shows prevalence:</strong> high screen time is a normal part
    of daily life for many students.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>MTF shows consequences:</strong> students with heavier screen use
    are less likely to report being very happy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students with high screen time are also less likely to view
    counseling and mental health resources as helpful.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This combination is especially concerning. The students who may benefit
  the most from school-based mental health supports appear to be
  the least connected to them.
</p>

<h2>From screen time to support systems</h2>

<p>
  Taken together, the MTF and YRBS findings raise a critical follow-up question:
  <strong>Do school-based mental health supports reach students equitably - and do
  students perceive them as helpful across demographic groups?</strong>
</p>



    <h3>Exploring differences across students</h3>

<p>
  The interactive dashboard below allows users to explore how perceptions
  of school-based mental health supports vary across different student groups.
  Filters can be used to compare patterns by <strong>race, gender, happiness,
  and future outlook</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than showing one average experience, this dashboard highlights
  how mental health support is perceived differently depending on who students are
  and how they feel about their lives and futures.
</p>
 <h2>Interactive Mental Health Support Dashboard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the dropdown filters to explore differences by race,
    gender, happiness level, and future outlook.
  </li>
  <li>
    Charts update automatically based on your selections.
  </li>
  <li>
    All charts display the distribution of responses within each group.
  </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Key patterns from the interactive dashboard</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Race:</strong> Perceptions of counseling and mental health resources
    vary by race, with some groups more likely to report that supports were
    not offered or not helpful.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Gender:</strong> Differences by gender suggest that access to
    and trust in school-based mental health supports is not evenly distributed.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Happiness:</strong> Students who report lower happiness are
    less likely to view counseling and mental health resources as helpful,
    even though they may need support the most.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Future outlook:</strong> Students who feel pessimistic about their
    future are more likely to report weak connections to school mental health supports.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why these filters matter</h3>

<p>
  The slicers at the top of the dashboard are not just design features, they are central to understanding risk and inequity.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Filtering by <strong>happiness</strong> shows that students with poorer
    emotional well-being are often the least likely to find school supports helpful.
  </li>

  <li>
    Filtering by <strong>future outlook</strong> highlights a group of students
    who may feel disconnected not only from school, but from long-term support systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    Looking across <strong>race and gender</strong> reveals gaps that may reflect
    differences in access, cultural relevance, or trust in school services.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These patterns suggest that need alone does not guarantee access - and that existing supports may not be reaching students most at risk.
</p>

    <h3>Why this matters for policy</h3>
<p>
  The interactive dashboard reinforces the same conclusion seen in the
  MTF and YRBS analyses: mental health risk is not evenly distributed,
  and current school-based supports do not consistently align with student need.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Efforts to improve adolescent mental health cannot focus only on
    individual behavior or screen limits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Schools must also invest in making mental health supports
    <strong>visible, accessible, and trusted</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    This includes normalizing help-seeking, improving counselor access,
    and ensuring services reach students most affected by heavy digital use.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Together, the YRBS and MTF findings support the core argument of this project:
  addressing adolescent mental health requires both
  <strong>reducing harmful digital overload</strong> and
  <strong>strengthening school-based mental health infrastructure</strong>.
