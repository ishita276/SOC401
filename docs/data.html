  <h2>Interactive Data Dashboard</h2>
  <p>
    This dashboard brings together national data from the
    <strong>Monitoring the Future (MTF)</strong> study to explore how
    high school students' screen time relates to happiness and views of
    school mental health support.
  </p>

  <!-- 1. Three-outcomes line chart -->
  <h3>1. Positive Outcomes by Screen Time (Interactive)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>How to use:</strong> Hover over the points and lines to see
    the exact percentage of students who are very happy, who find school
    counseling helpful, and who find school mental health resources
    helpful at each level of weekday screen time. Click items in the
    legend to hide or show each outcome.

  <!-- 2. Radar chart -->
  <h3>2. Digital Well-Being Profile by Screen Time (Interactive Radar)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>How to use:</strong> Each colored shape represents one
    screen-time group (&lt;3 hours, 3–6 hours, 7+ hours). The farther a
    point is from the center, the higher the percentage of students in
    that group who report that outcome. Hover to see the exact values;
    toggle groups on and off using the legend.

  <!-- 3. Short analysis -->
  <h3>What this dashboard shows</h3>
  <p>
    These charts use MTF survey data on 12th graders. Screen-time is
    grouped into three categories: less than 3 hours, 3–6 hours, and
    7+ hours of video/TV on devices on a typical weekday. The outcomes
    are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Very happy</strong> – students who describe themselves as very happy overall.</li>
    <li><strong>Counseling helpful</strong> – students who say school counseling is quite or extremely helpful.</li>
    <li><strong>Mental health resources helpful</strong> – students who say school mental health resources are quite or extremely helpful.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Looking across the dashboard, students with <strong>lower daily screen
    time</strong> are more likely to report being very happy and to see
    school-based supports as helpful. As screen time rises into the 7+ hour
    range, the share of “very happy” students drops, and fewer students feel
    strongly positive about school counseling and mental health resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together with the YRBS findings (which show how common high screen time
    is among U.S. high school students), this dashboard supports the
    argument in my op-ed and policy brief: schools need to both
    <strong>address heavy digital use</strong> and <strong>strengthen
    visible, trusted mental health supports</strong>, especially for the
    students who are online the most.

  <h2>Screen Time by Gender (YRBS 2021)</h2>
<p>
  The chart below shows the proportion of U.S. high school students who report
  spending <strong>3+ hours of daily screen time</strong> outside of schoolwork, broken 
  down by gender, using nationally representative YRBS 2021 data.
