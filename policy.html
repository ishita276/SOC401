  <h2>Policy Options</h2>

  <h3>Option 1: Platform Risk Assessments and Transparency</h3>
  <p>
    One approach is to require large platforms to conduct regular risk assessments for youth and
    publish summaries of their findings. Inspired by the United Kingdom's Online Safety Act, this
    option would:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mandate assessments of how recommendation systems, advertising, and design features affect minors.</li>
    <li>Require platforms to document what they are doing to mitigate identified risks.</li>
    <li>Give regulators access to more information about internal safety practices.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This option increases transparency but relies heavily on self-reporting and does not guarantee
    standardized, shareable data about youth outcomes.
  </p>

  <h3>Option 2: Youth-Centered Design Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    A second option focuses on product design. Building on laws like California's Age-Appropriate
    Design Code, it would require:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-privacy defaults for minors, with limited data collection and profiling.</li>
    <li>Restrictions on features that nudge endless scrolling or late-night use.</li>
    <li>Clear, age-appropriate safety and reporting tools built into platforms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Design rules can directly improve the user experience for young people, but they still leave a
    gap: policymakers would know that some design changes were made, but not how those changes
    affect mental health across different groups over time.
  </p>

  <h3>Option 3: Federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative (Recommended)</h3>
  <p>
    The recommended option is to create a federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative that
    treats data about youth digital environments as a public good. This initiative would:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standardize key indicators of youth digital behavior and mental health across federal surveys.</li>
    <li>Establish privacy-protective data-sharing agreements with platforms to obtain aggregated metrics on youth engagement and harms.</li>
    <li>Integrate data across agencies (such as education, health, and consumer protection) for a fuller picture of risk.</li>
    <li>Support real-time dashboards so policymakers can see early warning signs and evaluate new regulations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Rather than treating each platform as its own separate black box, this initiative would build a
    shared, youth-centered digital well-being infrastructure. It could coexist with design rules and
    risk assessments, but it would ensure that public institutions—not just private companies—have
    the information needed to protect young people.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Option 3 Is Preferred</h2>
  <p>
    Option 3 addresses the core problem identified on this site: we cannot manage what we do not
    measure. Transparent data on youth mental health and digital behavior would:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow regulators to prioritize the most harmful features and populations at highest risk.</li>
    <li>Help schools and communities target limited resources where they are most needed.</li>
    <li>Enable ongoing evaluation of whether new policies and platform changes are actually working.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Without such an initiative, debates over youth and technology will continue to be driven by
    anecdotes, industry public relations, and cycles of moral panic. A federal Youth Digital
    Well-Being Data Initiative would make it possible to move from vibes to evidence.
