  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last decade, rates of sadness, anxiety, and self-harm among young people in the
    United States have risen sharply. At the same time, adolescents are spending more of their
    daily lives inside AI-driven digital environments – especially social media platforms that
    constantly optimize for attention and engagement rather than well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website argues that youth mental health should not depend on opaque algorithms and
    unregulated data practices. It presents evidence that current systems are failing young
    people, describes how AI-powered recommendation systems can intensify harm, and makes the
    case for a federal Youth Digital Well-Being Data Initiative that would give policymakers
    timely, integrated, and youth-centered information about digital risks.
  </p>

  <h3>What this site does</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Explains how AI-driven platforms intersect with existing youth mental health crises.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence &amp; Data:</strong> Highlights key descriptive statistics from national surveys and other data sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Policy Solution:</strong> Compares policy options and advocates for a federal digital well-being data infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Take Action:</strong> Shares a student perspective and concrete steps different stakeholders can take.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is not to “blame phones” for every problem in young people’s lives. Instead, this
    project focuses on the policy choices we can control: what data governments collect, how
    platforms are held accountable, and whether youth voices are centered in decisions about
    their digital futures.
